# Edu-Meet Scholarly WebApp
This is my minor Project
# Description

College Portal:-
If a student is willing to meet any faculty member for doubt clearance on any topic or discussion on any project, then he/she have to visit his/her cabin and there arises a situation a certain times that teacher may not be present in his/her cabin and this leads to the wastage of time of the student as we all know that time is one of the most precious thing in our life and time is the only capital human has and he canâ€™t afford to lose. 
Similarly If a teacher wants to meet student then the teacher has to sent mail to the student by finding their details and manually sending the mail , So it is very time consuming and a long process. 

Extended version:-

Scholarly portal:-

We face certain challenges in our lives that can be difficult, and we often find ways to overcome them. Similarly, we encounter problems in our schools and colleges. One such problem motivated our group members to work on this project with dedication and hard work. Our motivation for undertaking this challenging project was to solve a problem that we face in our schools and colleges.
In every university or college, research is conducted on a daily basis by scholars and staff in various fields. Therefore, there is a need to properly maintain and analyse their research papers or publications. While many individuals use platforms like Google Scholar, there are certain issues that this platform does not consider. In this project, our group members have designed a similar scholarly portal that addresses these small details or issues and includes more features than Google Scholar to make it more reliable and user-friendly.
