# Minor-1-project
This is my minor Project
# Description
If a student is willing to meet any faculty member for doubt clearance on any topic or discussion on any project, then he/she have to visit his/her cabin and there arises a situation a certain times that teacher may not be present in his/her cabin and this leads to the wastage of time of the student as we all know that time is one of the most precious thing in our life and time is the only capital human has and he canâ€™t afford to lose. 
Similarly If a teacher wants to meet student then the teacher has to sent mail to the student by finding their details and manually sending the mail , So it is very time consuming and a long process.
