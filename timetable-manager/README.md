# Introduction:-
College Portal:-

We face certain problems in our life that could be challenging and we find paths in our life to find solutions of that problems. Similarly we face problems in our schools and colleges. There is such problem that motivated our group members to work upon this project with full dedication and hard-work. The motivation for doing this project was primarily an interest in undertaking a challenging project and solve one of our problem that we face in our schools and colleges. 
The relationship between student and teacher must be very interactive in nature, If a student wants to discuss their problem with the teacher then the teacher must cooperate with the student to solve their doubts which are very important for their studies.
Our group have designed a web application in which a student can book a meet with the teacher with full flexibility and if the teacher is free at that slot he/she can fix that time for the meet or if he/she is not free then can assign another time slot to the student. If the faculty member wants to meet a particular student then they can send a email to that particular student and that student will get notified about the meeting. So this makes a two-way communication between teacher and the student by just booking the time slot and meeting without wasting any time.
So with the help and guidance of our mentor, our group has worked upon this project with full determination to find the solution of this problem.

Scholarly portal:-


Our group has designed a another portal that allows scholars or staff members to view their publications and upload their documents. They can also obtain a PDF format of all their citation and publication information without wasting time. This single platform provides individuals with the best and least time-consuming experience for listing all their publication details and respective ranking in the institution.
Admin assigns staff members rankings according to their citations, and also visualizes and generalizes the data in a tabular manner. The admin has provided the document for each and every member's details with citations and individual member data in PDF format. The application also includes additional features such as visualizing and generalizing the data in a tabular manner and assigning staff rankings according to their citations.
With the guidance of our mentor, our group worked on this project with a determination to find a solution to this problem.
This can help in making informed decisions about promotions and other rewards for staff members based on their research output. Overall, our project can help streamline the process of maintaining and analysing research publications in universities and colleges, making it more efficient and user-friendly for scholars and staff members.
